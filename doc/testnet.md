# testnets

We have first deployed our smart contract in Ropsten (deprecated). We are migrating to Goerli.

## Goerli
Goerli is a proof-of-stake testnet. It is expected to be maintained long-term as a stable testnet for application developers. Before its testnet merge, Goerli was a proof-of-authority testnet.
